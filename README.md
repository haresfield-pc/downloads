# Parish Council downloads

This is where you upload files which can be downloaded from the website.

**Don't use this for meeting minutes - those need to be uploaded [here](https://github.com/haresfield-pc/minutes).**

Each time you upload or delete a file it will trigger an update of the Parish Council website. 

It will take a minute or two for the update, then you will see the new file in the downloads list:
